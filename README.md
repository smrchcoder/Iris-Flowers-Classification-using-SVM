# Iris-Flowers-Classification-using-SVM
The provided code employs Support Vector Machine (SVM) for Iris flower classification. It loads the dataset, conducts statistical analysis, and visualizes data relationships. Two models are developed: the first considers all features and the second focuses on sepal and petal lengths. Both models are trained, tested, and evaluated using SVM. Despite feature selection, both models yield similar classification results. The code justifies SVM's choice due to its effectiveness in well-separated classes and ability to handle non-linearities using kernels. In a concise summary, the code utilizes SVM to classify Iris flowers, presents two models, highlights SVM's advantages, and demonstrates consistent classification performance.
